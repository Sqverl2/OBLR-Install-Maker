Get latest build: [HERE](https://github.com/Sqverl2/OBLR-Install-Maker/releases/latest/download/OBLRInstallMaker.7z)


Instructions:
1) Download latest build of this program.  
2) Download everything on the [Oblivion Remastered mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/49784?tab=description) as usual. (Due to Licences and such one can't make a program to auto download those for you.)  
3) Dump everything you've downloaded into OBLR v(VERSION)\OBLR 7zips\ folder provided to you in root folder of the program, or anywhere else realy, just make sure to tell the program where.  
4) Launch program. If already launched press Refresh.  
5) This feature is not heavily tested, as it's mostly useless. But If you wish for downloads to be structured the same way as in tutorial(As in separated into folders by stage) you can press "Fix Locations".  
6) Press "Unpack all", and one eternety later you will be prompted to install Ivellon, because it's a special snowflake of a mod. Just follow instruction in video at [37:46](https://youtu.be/jS08eR8AKEU?t=2266) on where to put stuff.  
7) When done with copying Ivellon, press ok and let the program finish its job. It should show a message when done.  
8) Continue manual installation at about [40](https://youtu.be/jS08eR8AKEU?t=2462) minute mark.  
9) As always, go fun yourself.  

Some colorcoding description:
1) If mod frame is gray - the program has no idea where the mod is. You've lost it. Unpacking can't proceed.  
2) If mod frame is yellow - the program knows where your mod is, but it's not in location specified in tutorial. Unpacking can proceed, and I don't forsee any problems unless 2 mods are incidentally named the same.  
3) If mod frame is blue - the mod is where it is expected to be. You can proceed with unpacking.  
4) If mod frame is red - Something went horribly wrong, I hope no nukes are flying and your PC isn't burning in blue flame.  
5) If mod frame is green - It was successfully unpacked. The program will forget this fact if you relaunch it, because mods are unpacked one upon the other with files being overwritten.  

Minor statements about this project:  
This is a project I've done in my free time, just because.
All code was written using principle I thus dub:  
(S)eparation of concern? You should be concerned I don't separate your unit from from the rest of your body.  
(H)ow extendable is this? Like very, you can throw away all code and extend in any direction.  
(I)nterfaces vs Composition. How about none?  
(T)esting? I've tested it, once... maybe... what's a unit test? I test my unit daily.  

Seriously, this is something you will use once, maybe. (I hope, please don't use it more than once? I beg you.)
